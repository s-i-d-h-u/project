      <em>C++</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      C++ (pronounced "C plus plus") is a general-purpose programming language
      created by Danish computer scientist <em>Bjarne Stroustrup</em> as an
      extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language
      has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has
      object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to
      facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always
      implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++
      compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel,
      Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

    <h2><em>JAVA</em></h2>
    <p>
      Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language
      that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
      It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers
      <em>write once, run anywhere (WORA)</em>, meaning that compiled Java code
      can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
      Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any
      Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
      architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer
      low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides
      dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification)
      that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of
      2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use
      according to <em>GitHub</em>,particularly for clientâ€“server web
      applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

    <h2><em>HTML</em></h2>
    <p>
      The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
      or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
      included cues for the appearance of the document.

    <h2><em>css</em></h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
      or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a
      cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
      content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
      content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
      specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages
      to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
      file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
      and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
      between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    <h2><em>C</em></h2>
    <p>
      C (pronounced like the letter c) is a general-purpose computer programming
      language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very
      widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the
      capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating
      systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly[6] for
      application software. C is commonly used on computer architectures that
      range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and
      embedded systems.
